## Getting Started with pnpm
* What is pnpm? Fast, disk space efficient package manager.
* Main advantage: Files inside node_modules are cloned or hard linked from a single content-addressable storage so that they are not downloaded multiple times on your device.
### Installing
* Watch this [useful video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvbReZDSKHI&ab_channel=CodinginPublic)
* Read the [docs](https://pnpm.io/installation)
* Install pnpm by running "npm i -g pnpm"
* Make sure it's successfully installed by cloning this repo and running "pnpm i" which should install node_modules

### Useful Commands
* pnpm start: Runs the app in the development mode (like npm start)
* pnpm i: Installs all dependencies
* pnpm add <pkg>: Adds a new package to the project
